# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) using Rust.

All the examples can be tested by running `cat input.txt | cargo run` from the respective day.

## Day 1
Learned about [map_while](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map_while) and itertools' [batching](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.batching).
